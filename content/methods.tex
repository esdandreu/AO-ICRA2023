\section{Methods} \label{chap:methods}

This work proposes a system capable of estimating motion from audio signals.
Shown in \cref{fig:system}, it is a modular system that consists of two
components: a feature extraction module composed of several \emph{extractor}
submodules. It receives a multi-channel audio signal of a fixed length and
outputs a group of feature vectors, one per extractor submodule; and a
prediction model that receives a segment composed of a finite number of feature
frames and outputs a motion estimation. Between both modules, previous feature
frames are stored in memory.

The sections present in this chapter deepen in the different modules that
compose the proposed system. Starting with the audio signal,
\cref{sec:experimental-setup} describes how the data used in this work was
gathered. \Cref{sec:datasets} describes the feature extraction module and the
segment composition. Finally, \cref{sec:models} describes the different
prediction models used in this work.
