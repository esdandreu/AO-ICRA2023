\section{Methods} \label{sec:methods}

This work proposes a system capable of estimating motion from audio signals.
Shown in \cref{fig:system}, it is a modular system that consists of two
components: a \nameref{subsec:feature-extraction} module composed of several
\emph{extractor} submodules and a \nameref{subsec:prediction-model}. The
proposed system is implemented in C++ as a Python extension module and it is
publicly available in github under the
\href{https://github.com/AcousticOdometry}{Acoustic Odometry
organization}\footnote{https://github.com/AcousticOdometry}

% Review35: Unfortunately, the authors don't sufficiently substantiate
% their algorithm's novelty and performance improvement over similar works.
