\section{Methods} \label{sec:methods}

% REVIEW29 In methods, this paper shows very limited innovation in feature
% extraction and prediction model. The design and implementation of the CNN is
% unclear because the elaboration of Figure 3 is insufficient. The direct
% output of the prediction model is also unclear.

This work proposes a system capable of estimating motion from audio signals.
Shown in \cref{fig:system}, it is a modular system that consists of two
components: a \nameref{subsec:feature-extraction} module composed of several
\emph{extractor} submodules and a \nameref{subsec:prediction-model}. The proposed
system is implemented in C++ as a Python extension module and it is publicly
available in github under the
