\section{Experiments} \label{sec:experiments}

Due to the difficulty in finding publicly available audio odometry datasets,
the problem of robot localization is simplified to a single dimension over a
unique terrain type: A wheel that can only move along a longitudinal axis over
loose sandy terrain. As this scenario can be easily reproduced with the
available \nameref{subsec:experimental-setup}, making it possible to gather a
new \nameref{subsec:datasets}.

\subsection{Datasets} \label{subsec:datasets}

\subsubsection{Training} \label{subsubsec:training-dataset} A collection of
annotated overlapping audio frames used to train and test the
\nameref{subsec:prediction-model}.

The annotated variables are the longitudinal velocity $V_x$, the wheel angular
speed $V_\omega$ and the slip ratio $s$. This work annotates the audio frames
with a weighted average of the measurements within its duration.

Audio frames are extracted from test recordings where the wheel test bed is
used to control different variables as the slip ratio and the wheel angular
velocity. A total of 168 different recordings that make a total of 1 hour for
each of the 6 microphones where captured for the training dataset.  

\subsubsection{Evaluation} \label{subsubsec:evaluatio-dataset} 7 recordings
with a total duration of 17 minutes used to evaluate the performance of the
system under more realistic and challenging conditions. Unlike in the test
dataset, where the longitudinal position was controlled by the wheel test bed,
the carriage unit is allowed free longitudinal movement and only the wheel
drive motor is active. High wheel slippage is induced by external forces and
the shape of the terrain.


\subsection{Selected model} \label{subsec:selected-model} 

% TODO Model experiments
Experiments are conducted varying the different tuneable parameters in the
\nameref{subsec:feature-extraction} module and
\nameref{subsec:prediction-model} and a model is selected based on its
performance and computational cost.

% TODO More info about the model. A table would be nice.

This work selects a model trained on a dataset of segments of 50 frames, each
of them spans over 15 milliseconds and has 64 features from a single Gammatone
filterbank extractor. The extractor is applied on the average of the audio
signal channels with a frequency range of [50, 8000] Hz and features are
represented on the Bel scale. The model is trained with data from a subset of
microphones (1, 2, 4 and 6 as shown in \cref{fig:wheeltestbed-setup-2}).
Training data is augmented with added random SNR noise. The model task is to
classify the longitudinal velocity given a set of 28 different linearly
distributed longitudinal velocity ranges taking into account the order of the
classes, ordinal classification, as introduced in \cite{ordclass2006}. The
selected model makes use of a batch normalization layer and has a size of
51.5MB.
