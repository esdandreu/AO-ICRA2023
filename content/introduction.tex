\Cref{sec:methods} describes the proposed system while \cref{sec:experiments}
shows how the proposed system is trained and tunned for a wheeled robot on
loose sandy terrain. \Cref{sec:results} evaluates the proposed system,
including a discussion of the results and recommendations on future research on
acoustic odometry that can be found in \cref{subsec:discussion}. Finally,
\cref{chap:conclusions} summarizes the most important contributions of this
research.
