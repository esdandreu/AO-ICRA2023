\subsection{Motivation} \label{subsec:motivation}

This work intends to minimize the price of robust ground robot localization in
unstructured environments by using sensors that are relatively inexpensive,
imply a low overhead, and might be needed for other functionalities of the
robot: acoustic odometry. Many ground mobile robots will be equipped with sound
sensors for the purpose of human-robot interaction \cite{VoiceForklift}, at the
same time, audio signals have been extensively studied, resulting in very
efficient methods for their processing.

Increasing the robustness of robot localization in unstructured environments
without significantly increasing its price would make this technology more
accessible. Which complies with the 9th and 10th Sustainable Development Goals:
Promotes innovation without increasing the inequalities between small and big
producers \cite{SDG}.
